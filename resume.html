            <p>I'm Ellen Macpherson, currently turning coffee into TV and mobile apps in BT's Belfast office.</p>
            <p>I'm also an Aussie away from home, a podcast enthusiast and a dog person.</p>
            <p> The things
                that really get me excited include: front-end development, human-centered design, great user research and adovcating for
                workplace diversity and inclusion. </p>
                <p>I'm available for small freelance projects and consultations about design. So if you'd like to discuss a new blog, small-scale website, UIs or user experience, hit that üìû on the top right of the screen. <span class='point-icon'>‚òùÔ∏è</span> </p>

        <section class="long-bio">
            <div class="who">
                <h2>Who I am</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A native Sydneysider, currently based in the UK.</li>
                    <li>I started out with degrees in history and politics and a professional background in customer service and content creation. I'm living proof that you don't need a computer science degree to be a developer.</li>
                    <li>In short, I'm a career changer with an interest in how tech affects the lives of people. I also really like designing websites.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <div class="what">
                <h2>What I can do</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>I work primarily with HTML, CSS (incl. Sass), and JavaScript and am also familiar with Python for web development and data analytics.</li>
                    <li>Full time, I help maintain and add new features to BT's TV platform, a service that goes out to millions of users every month. Most of my day job involves asking "but why?"</li>
                    <li>User-focused products are the best products. If you're trying to make something cool that's also something your mum could use, give me a shout. I'd be happy to have a chat about it.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>


            <div class="why">
                <h2>The bigger picture</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am passionate about seeing more diversity in tech. I make up one of the 4% of software developers in the UK who identify as female, and I'm keen to get involved in making that a much larger number through making workplaces more inclusive.</li>
                    <li>I think coding is for everyone who wants to get involved. I firmly believe we cannot do a good job of hearing and representing the diversity of our customers views if we aren't diverse ourselves.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
