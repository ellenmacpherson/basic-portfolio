      <section id='about-content'>
        <h1 class='about-h1'>About</h1>
        <p class='first-p'>I'm a junior software developer, familiar with HTML5, CSS, JS and Python.</p>
        <p>Currently turning caffiene into TV and mobile apps in BT's Belfast office. I'm also an Aussie away from home, a podcast enthusiast and a dog person.</p>

        <h5>An Unconventional Path</h5>

        <p>Both my undergraduate and Masters degrees were in history and politics - about as far away from computer science and web design as you can get! It was during my Masters thesis, when I was studying the social media patterns of politicians,
          that I discovered Python. I used web scrapers and APIs to access data, and I was hooked. It was amazing to be able to develop a skill no-one (including myself!) thought I was capable of.</p>

        <p>From there, I had the immense privilege of joining 28 other incredible women on a digital intensive course run by Code First: Girls in conjunction with BT. This was where I built solid foundations for a career in software development and discovered my love of front-end development.</p>

        <h5>A Front-Ender</h5>

        <pclass='second-p'>While I had my first taste of coding with data analytics, I quickly discovered the joy of flexing my creative muscles on the front-end. Having spent over seven years in customer service before I joined my current team at BT, I am constantly reminding myself of what the customer sees and experiences. It's my aim to create personal, clean, accessible apps driven by customer data and built with empathy.</p>

          <h5>A Diversity Cheerleader</h5>

          <pclass='second-p'>My time with Code First: Girls was an amazing opportunity, not only for the skills it taught me but because it really sold me the reality that coding is for everyone. It's for graduates, those without university backgrounds, career changers and career returners. It's for women, BAME communities, LGBT people and people from low-income backgrounds. There's no better time to be entering the tech industry, but there's also no better time for the tech world to invest in increasing opportunities for everyone.</p>

          <p>It's only good business sense.</p>

          <p>I hope to mentor other career changers, particularly women and economically disadvantaged young people, to help them realise their own goals in the tech industry. I aim to contribute to our community by having honest conversations about how we can make tech spaces less intimidating for people with non-tech backgrounds.</p>
